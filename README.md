## Info
We’re excited to announce the launch of a new course: Fast Prototyping of GenAI Apps with Streamlit, created in collaboration with Snowflake, taught by Chanin Nantasenamat, known as The Data Professor on YouTube, and available on Coursera. 
Traditional development cycles, where it takes months of planning before anything ships, don’t work in the era of generative AI. New capabilities surface every week, and ideas lose momentum unless you put a prototype in front of people fast.

This course helps you work around this shift. You’ll learn a repeatable workflow to go from idea to share-ready demo software in days, not months. 

You’ll start with a simple chatbot, then add prompt engineering and RAG powered by Snowflake’s secure data and LLM services, and push your prototype to Snowflake or Streamlit Community Cloud for instant feedback and rapid improvement.

In detail, you'll: 
•	Build an interactive Streamlit analytics assistant that mines a customer-review dataset for sentiment insights within your own Snowflake account (120-day free trial included).
•	Improve response quality with structured prompt engineering and RAG, grounding each answer in the review data.
•	Ship your prototype to internal Snowflake workspaces, or publish it to Streamlit Community Cloud, gather feedback, and iterate fast with the course’s MVP playbook.
If you’re tired of overplanning and ready to start building, this course is for you.

Keep learning,
